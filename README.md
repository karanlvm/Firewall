# Firewall
 A firewall is a system that is designed to prevent unauthorized access from entering a private network by filtering the information that comes in from the internet. A firewall is a network security device, either hardware or software-based, which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules it accepts, rejects or drops that specific traffic.  This project proposes Network Security to a small Private Network using a hardware firewall called the ASA Firewall (Adaptive Security Appliance) by protecting the network from malicious third-party networks, hosts i.e., the internet.
